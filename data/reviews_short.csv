44616,706908,2011-11-09,634733,Lindsay,Forget staying in a hotel. Stay at condesa haus. Fernando is super cool. The space/neighborhood is lovely. Don't forget to go to the roof. I wish I'd had more time to spend there. Till next time in Mexico city!
44616,2006160,2012-08-16,3087087,Samuel,"Fantastic location, great place, friendly host(s) - all round highly recommended as a place to stay for both first timers to Mexico City and return visitors. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!"
44616,3174954,2012-12-28,3234920,Anna,"I would highly recommend Condesa Haus for anyone visiting Mexico City. Perfectly located, with a lot of restaurants, coffee shops and great walking in the area, a very safe and atmospheric place. The house itself is beautiful with many period details. Just as seen in the photos. <br/><br/>Fernando and the rest of the crue were truly great hosts - friendly, knowledgeable and flexible. We enjoyed chatting over breakfast, getting more ideas about our vacation plans and just getting to know local folks. "
44616,3271579,2013-01-04,2199822,Shelley And Pall,Great stay. Thanks. Highly recommend. 
607833,7570893,2013-09-24,8531917,Daniel,"We had a great stay with Omar.  We know DF very well but he still walked us between the metro stop and his house.  He had good coffee for us every morning.  With hot showers, internet, and a wonderful bed we were very content.  He'll talk your ear off with lots of information about getting around Mexico and particularly the basilica area where he lives.  He's a sensitive guy and a very good conversationalist.  We highly recommend him. You're welcome to contact us if you want more info.  Dan and María"
607833,10334005,2014-02-14,7526272,Juha,Omar is nice and lively guy with his activities...also good company.
607833,15723718,2014-07-14,17494147,Allison,"i feel very fortunte that we found omars little corner of d.f. the neighborhood is a  bustling place that seems to have remained unchanged by commerce and technology.  and as omar was born and raised there, he made an excellent host/tour guide.  the apartment was very warm and welcoming as were his neighbors. omar is very generous and an excellent cook (he will insist on making you breakfast each morning). a great experience overall."
607833,16170354,2014-07-22,11055845,Colin,"Omar was a great host. The room was very clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. He cooked me a delicious meal every day at whatever time I requested.  He showed me around his neighborhood, and he is very well informed about the Basilica and the other important architecture and art nearby. It was a pleasure staying with him."
607833,36827382,2015-07-01,36446254,Memo,"GRACIAS, Omar, muy amable, confiable, todo muy limpio y ordenado, un lugar muy còmodo, confortable, buen espacio y una decoraciòn calida,,, super bien, altamente recomendable y sobre todo regreso, la ubicaciòn, correcta,"
607833,77485828,2016-06-01,60486981,Paúl,"Excelente mi estancia en el departamento, muy buen trato, todos los servicios, anfitriones amigables y serviciales, dispuestos a ayudar siempre. Gracias por todo, Omar y familia Marmolejo.<br/>My status in the apartment was excellent, very good deal, all services, friendly and helpful hosts, always willing to help. Thanks for everything, Omar and family Marmolejo."
44616,3841065,2013-03-19,2423825,Leonardo,"This was not a very good experience I am afraid to say. The first one with AIRBNB. More in details<br/>The good<br/>1. The neighborhood is  fantastic, great to go out, full of restaurant, green and bars. It is one of the best areas in Mexico City to walk around<br/>2. The house is nice and the breakfast is fine<br/>The bad<br/>1. You see various pictures on the site but then you don't know what you will get. I don't know if we were unlucky but we got a tiny room (no picture of that were on the site) so you don't (necessarily) get what you see<br/>2. Our room had a problem, the toilet was not flushing so we asked to be changed and after some negotiations the person working there realized this was really a problem and changed us. <br/>3. We slept for one night in a nice room however when we came back in the evening our room was occupied by someone else. The people working at the house had taken all our stuff and moved it - I find it incredible, it was the first time, that someone would be doing this - we had left a lot things in the room and things had to be moved and obviously be put in a totally different order. <br/>4. We were told that in our old room the toilet problem had been fixed but it was not true. Even worse, the guy working there pretended I was being annoying and it had been fixed until when I obliged him to come and check by himself- the toilet was still not flushing (so we could not use it). He accepted it but could not do anything. <br/>5. We were offered the option to go sleeping elsewhere for that night but it was already 10.30pm - and we would have had to go back the day after. I declined and was promised the day after the toilet would have been fixed<br/>6. The day after the toilet was finally flushing but an awful smell would come out. It was late, we were exhausted so decided to still spend there the last night but not go back. <br/>I had explained to Fernando I would leave this review and I was sorry for that, it is not nice to leave a bad review but I think it is fair for other people. In the end he was kind and did not charge me for the laundry (a couple of shirts and one pair of trousers). I found that a kind gesture but frankly not enough to cancel all that had gone wrong. <br/>Overall<br/>Based on my experience, I would suggest to guests to look for some other place in Condesa. <br/>"
44616,3881663,2013-03-24,3883757,Brad,"Condesa Haus is an incredible place to stay in Mexico City- it's unique and beautiful, located right in the middle of the trendy Condesa Neighborhood. Fernando, the owner, and his staff will make you feel right at home. These guys go above and beyond to make sure you experience is perfect (for what it's worth, I used to work in the hospitality industry and have fairly high expectations). Staying at Condesa Haus was definitely one of my favorite parts of the trip. My friend and I both agreed that the Porforio Room was the coolest room that either of us had ever stayed in. The roof top deck is perfect for lounging at the end of the day, or all day for that matter. Breakfast was informal and tasty and a great time to hit up Fernando for recommendations. He'll draw you a map and make sure you know exactly what to do. By the end of the trip we had a collection of his maps. Ask him about the history and themes of each room. Ask him about the restaurant in the cave behind the pyramid. Ask him to take you out for mezcal;) The property is an old estate that he and his partner tastefully modernized. Such a great place. I highly recommend Condesa Haus. Can't wait to go back someday!"
44616,5141442,2013-06-15,5501478,Juliet,"Both Condesa Haus and Fernando where awesome! Everybody was very helpfull and friendly. The rooms we beautiful and clean, and the breakfast delicious! Location is perfect aswell. I would recommend everybody to use Condese Haus during their stay in Mexico City"
44616,7566860,2013-09-24,7677437,Offir,"We were really disappointed with the Condesa Haus room we got. <br/>The room looks nothing like the photos displayed. The bathtub shown in the photos are not representative of what we got which is a standard household bathtub. Moreover, the room was in bad condition. The bathroom wall was decaying. We felt it should not be an appropriate room to host in. Especially not for the price we paid.<br/>We felt a bit cheated.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the staff was kind and helpful. And the breakfast was good. The complex and neighborhood felt very safe."
44616,8547364,2013-11-04,260245,Olivier,"GREAT STAFF, CLEAN & SPACIOUS ROOMS.<br/><br/>While the room did not look as pristine as the one from the pictures,  we really enjoyed our stay at Condesa Haus. <br/><br/>Fernando was kind enough to accommodate an extra bed in our bedroom for my friend to stay.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
1441434,6292241,2013-08-06,4956237,Nicholas,"Mireya was waiting for me in the lobby when I arrived, introduced me to the apartment and gave me a tour of the facilities, pool, health club, etc.<br/>The apartment was clean, comfortable and quiet, with a nice view of the rooftop garden, very secure, and a great location.  Mireya is an attentive, thoughtful host and I can recommend her place without hesitation.  Thanks Mireya for such a nice stay!<br/>Mireya me saludó en la entrada cuando llegué, y mostro el depa, alberca, club de fitness. El depa fue limpio, comodo y tranquilo, Es un lugar muy seguro con vistas al jardin del techo, y muy bien ubicada.  Mireya es anfitriona atentiva y generosa con su tiempo, respondió rapido a cualquier pregunta, y ofrece un depa bien arreglado y agradable.  Gracias Mireya por todo, recomiendo tu depa a todos!"
44616,9291603,2013-12-18,4650919,Catherine,I only spent one night at Condesa Haus but it was absolutely perfect. I stayed in the studio apartment and I would love to come back and rent that space for more time. Fernando is super hospitable and the staff was very helpful and kind. Thanks again Fernando! 
44616,9775832,2014-01-09,15868,Svitlana,"My wife and I spent a week  in early Jan. <br/>Let me preface my review by explaining that Condesa Haus is a boutique B & B. This is unlike all our other airbnb experiences where the apartment was privately owned. As a result,there is housekeeping, reception staff and breakfast. By far the best part of our stay was the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, informative. In a casual way they are the ones that really made the stay a pleasant one. Our room, which was on the second floor and faced the back, was really basic. Small, creaky floors, dim lights, lumpy foam pillows, very little closet/storage. BUT.....clean, great WIFI and TV, decent washroom and shower, little or no street noise. <br/>I would say equivalent to a 3 star hotel. The location in Condesa could not be better. Steps to Starbucks, cafes and restaurants. The metrobus on Insurgentes is a 10 min walk. There are two Metro stops about a 10 min walk. Roma is a pleasant 20 min walk. Polanca and the museums were a bit far for us to walk, but are certainly possible. The taxis were always able to get us back to Condesa Haus without a problem as the location seems to be well known. We read about all the problems with taxis, but never had a bad experience except that metered rides from the same locations would vary quite a lot. We could be in a taxi for 20-30 minutes and get charged 150 pesos and be in one for 5 min and get charged 115 pesos. Other than that, we always felt safe and for the most part taxi drivers were friendly. <br/>To sum up. Fernando was easy to communicate with and because there was a reception desk, the hotel could be called at any time. The staff was really great and helped us throughout the week. They seemed genuinely happy to help us. The hotel itself, an old building that has been cleaned up and painted, was never an issue. Maybe the bed mattress, pillows and sheets could use an upgrade in future, but although not the best quality, all was clean and tidy. Location, fantastic. <br/>Condesa Haus was not our first choice and I think Fernando has better properties as well, but because of the holiday season a lot of places were booked out. So I was not expecting a lot and in the end we had a very very pleasant stay. Although we might look elsewhere when we return to Mexico City, I would certainly not hesitate to return to Condesa Haus.<br/>"
44616,9809339,2014-01-11,11037221,Salem,"I was subject to the ""Bait and switch"" trick, wanted to stay at Condesa Haus, however was told it was fully booked (which was not true as I was considering booking there for a subsequent visit and visited Condesa Haus and all three rooms were free). The owner suggested that I stay in another of his B&Bs (Distrito Condesa) near by instead. I stayed there for two nights, On checkin (I arrived around 15:00) I had to wait about 20 minutes on the street for someone to come and open the door. the rooms are very old, very basic furniture, bathroom is very old, water leaking on the floor and into the room. Worst of all is the sound insulation, I could not sleep the second night because I could hear the guest in the next room clearing his throat! as if he was in the same room as me. The noise of someone going up and down some metal stairs connected to the outside of the property until 2am resonating into the room, the noise of some machine working on and off all night. All in all, terrible experience and would not recommend it to anyone."
1441434,6725418,2013-08-22,8256845,Ana,"My stay was very pleasant and Mireya was very kind always, from the reception to my departure, during my stayed there was a eartquake and she was always in touch. Everything was fine, the apartment was very quiet, very located and clean. Widely recommended."
1441434,7049920,2013-09-04,7529413,Andrew,"The apartment is great ... larger than the photos suggest. Nicely appointed and in an upscale shopping mall/complex.<br/><br/>Mireya was a fantastic host. She was very attentive and helpful!<br/><br/>Thanks!"
1441434,7249304,2013-09-13,905792,Diana,"El apartamento en maravilloso, MUY amplio! y con todo lo necesario para pasar unos días maravillosos. Su ubicación es muy central así que si se viaja por turismo es ideal para llegar a muchos lugares en poco tiempo. Tiene una estación de bus al lado, además que en el centro comercial se encuentra de todo, además de muy buenos lugares para desayunar, como El Bajío o Cielito lindo. <br/><br/>Mireya es una excelente anfitriona, fue muy flexible con nuestras necesidades. Además de ser muy detallista, nos dejó café, jugo, algunas frutas y eso hizo que nos sintiéramos en casa.<br/><br/>Muy recomendado! "
1441434,7468332,2013-09-21,7529413,Andrew,Mireya is wonderful host. The apartment is in a great location and is nicely furnished. I've stayed here twice now. I recommend this property!
1441434,7949806,2013-10-09,608396,Kiara,"Fantastic stay at Miraya's !<br/>Fue todo meravilloso . . . !!!!<br/>The apt is bigger comparing to the pictures, veeeeeeery clean and it's located in a perfect and safe area of Mexico City, 10/15 min walking to the subway.<br/>The bed is huuuuuge and so confy. Miraya has been very nice and helpful.<br/>We highly recommend this place, you won't regret it ;)"
1441434,8093035,2013-10-15,8768980,Lay,"Muy lindo el lugar, cómodo y con buenas instalaciones, mucho mejor  que lo que se muestra en fotos, bien ubicado y céntrico , excelente atención de la anfitriona, Mireya!"
1441434,8314522,2013-10-25,7529413,Andrew,"Mireya is a wonderful host. I have stayed here three times now. She always checks to see if everything is OK and meets me on time. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a great location, very convenient for Reforma, Chapultepec and Zona Rosa."
1441434,8489635,2013-11-02,9508238,Mathilde,"This apartment is absolutely perfect! I reccomand it if you need to be very smooth.  The neirberhood is very secure for woman. The terrasse is very sunny, the pool and the jacuzzi are very clean and pleasant.<br/>I would go back anytime!<br/>"
1441434,8733440,2013-11-14,2609735,Elizabeth,"All was great, clean, comfortable and just as expected.  Mireya was very nice and prompt in answering and making sure everything was fine.  Location is convenient to get everywhere with ease."
1441434,9193003,2013-12-12,8522521,Antonio,"Nuestra experiencia fue excelente! El departamento resultó ser más amplio de lo que parecia, muy cómodo y completo. Perfecto, todo limpio, organizado y de buen gusto. <br/>Mireya como anfitriona me pareció lo máximo! Muy atenta y preocupada por sus huespedes, cuidadosa hasta en los minimos detalles. El departamento por si mismo ya es lindo, pero los detalles, nos cautivaron!! <br/>La ubicación del departamento es excelente, todo está cerca y lo mejor: muchas cosas se pueden hacer a pie! Un lujo en la ciudad de México. "
1441434,9277605,2013-12-17,6945301,Juan Carlos,"The apartment is very clean and spacious. I highly recommend it.<br/>It is a block from Reforma and an easy walking distance to some of Mexico City's best neighborhoods. Exit the building and to the right is the touristic Zona Rosa, but go left and you walk into the tranquil Colonia Juarez. Roma is nearby and an easy 20 minute walk takes you to the trendy Condesa neighborhood. We walked there at night and felt safe. But take time to enjoy the very nicely heated pool and the spa. Do bring slippers and warm PJs because the apartment can be a little drafty. It's next to a Sanborn's -- what else can you ask for."
1441434,9365859,2013-12-24,1684868,Yvonne,"Mireya's apartment was exactly what we were looking for -- only better! It is right in the middle of everything -- shopping, restaurants, clubs, near the metro and busses, and overall just a great neighborhood to stay in.  The apartment was immaculately clean, with all modern amenities, and gorgeous views of the city.  Thanks again Mireya for a wonderful stay.  If we return to Mexico City, we will definitely rent your place again!"
1441434,9961175,2014-01-21,1246944,Scott,"First rate experience; Mireya is attentive and thoughtful down to little details like fresh fruit waiting in the apartment upon arrival, spare packaged toothbrushes in the bathroom, a tourist guide she made in the living room, and a small first aid kit in the closet. From the small things to the big things, Mireya is a very thoughtful and attentive person.<br/><br/>While we were there, the internet went down (not just for the apartment, but for the whole block, it turned out) - we let Mireya know and she had the Telmex folks on the phone within minutes and was at the apartment with her laptop within a half hour to try and debug it herself, and looking for other options for us. (Fortunately I'm told internet outages rarely happen, and it was a solid and fast connection once it was fixed.)<br/><br/>Based upon other places we rented through AirBNB in el DF, the apartment is also very competitively priced considering the apartment quality, location, and space. <br/><br/>A great experience, would definitely return, and we hope to keep in touch with Mireya!<br/><br/>"
1441434,10001976,2014-01-24,2393825,Yuyo,"Excelente ubicación y espacio Mireya estuvo al tanto de nuestro hospedaje y con excelente atención en los detalles.<br/>Muy recomendable, y superó por mucho nuestras expectativas."
1441434,10327169,2014-02-13,5796848,Cyrielle,"Great place, great location, very customer oriented, Mireya is a great host. We felt very much at home while staying there. thank you !"
1441434,10382332,2014-02-17,5766395,Samantha,"Our stay in Mireya's apartment was great.  The building was a little difficult for us to find, but once we did, we had no problems picking up the keys from the front desk and getting into the apartment.  The apartment is in a very nice and safe area and has good security.  The mall by the apartment was very convenient- plenty of restaurants and shopping.  And the metro station was just a few blocks away, easy to walk to.  The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed.  I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Mexico City!"
1441434,10516996,2014-02-23,1507617,Ricardo,"This place was amazing. The view is unbelievable. My wife and i came to mexico for our honeymoon. We've been all over the world but Mexico escaped us. Staying in convenient location to everything else and having taxi pickup server in the same building made it easy to see all the art and eat all the food we wanted to. My only complaint would be the smog in the city but that has nothing to do with this place. Mexico is truly the Paris of Central America, if you know what you're looking for and this place is amazing. Also, the rooftop heated pool was clutch. "
1441434,10597975,2014-02-26,12478439,Luis,"Encontré esta opción de último momento y en muy poco tiempo recibí preaprobación de Mireya.  Amabilidad y atención excepcionales, así como el sitio y su localización.  Una verdadera opción para disfrutar de la Ciudad de México.  Las amenidades del complejo son excelentes y la ubicación del departamento en el edificio muy buena.  Ampliamente recomendado."
1441434,10985917,2014-03-16,12484482,Elizabeth,"I just spent 12 days in mexico city on business and used airbnb for the first time. My experience was outstanding and I would definately stay at Mireya's place again - the experience was seamless and I felt at home - from the welcome fruit, water and cookies and small touches it made this so much better than staying at a hotel.  The location was perfect - lots of restaurants, starbucks right at your front door and I was able to walk to several of my meetings at plaza del angel.  I am in mexico city on business frequently and would definately stay at Mireya's place again.<br/>The only thing that was not clear to me was how to gain access - which is very convenient - there is a guard at the entrance who has the keys and elevator access card."
1441434,11589912,2014-04-08,12812985,Stephan,"Very nice and comfortable apartment in a near perfect location to enjoy Mexico City. It was good to have a green lawn and swimming pool (one floor down) to retreat to when the city became too much. Right on the edge of Condessa and Roma neighborhoods, 5 min from the subway and easy access to downtown and Polanco. Comfy bed and living area, and the double sinks and large shower are perfect. Never felt cramped, lots of light and nicely equipped place. Thanks, Mireya."
1441434,11697798,2014-04-12,1220086,Jason,"I was in Mexico for business.  Mireya's apartment is exactly as it is represented in the profile.  The building is of high quality construction and the location is perfect. The apartment exceeded my expectations.  Mireya's efforts to welcome me also exceed my expectations, and she went out of her way to help me find the apartment and to assist during my stay.  Thank you Mireya.  "
1441434,12931351,2014-05-14,14816880,Fernando,Very enjoyable stay. Mireya was very attentive and answered emails within the hour. The apartment is very comfortable and clear. It was accurately represented on the airbnb site. 
1441434,13286002,2014-05-24,2609735,Elizabeth,Mireya is a very attentive host.  Everything was fine with the stay.  Location is great.  Highly recommend this place.

1441434,14197909,2014-06-14,803124,Pilar,"Nuestra estadia fue muy buena, el apartamento es casi nuevo y está en una de las mejores areas del Distrito Federal de México. El apartamento tiene todo lo necesario para sentirse uno como en casa. Es accesible a los restaurantes y tiendas para comprar, esto en mi opinión es excelente. Mireya estuvo pendiente de nuestras necesidades y siempre en contacto. Me encanto y la próxima vez volveré sin lugar a dudas. Es un apartamento adorable!"
1441434,14519487,2014-06-21,15722161,Nealon,"Mireya's apartment was very easy to access. It was immaculately clean and just as described. Very roomy and has everything one needs (even laundry machines). She left some fruit and cold drinks in the fridge for me too.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is perfect to be right on Reforma. It's connected to 222 so has quick access to all the shops one needs. Ecobici (the bicycle sharing program has a station at the entrance to Torre 3) is so easy to use and makes DF a great city to visit and access. Lots of restaurants and bars right in Zona Rosa."
1441434,14871351,2014-06-28,10730363,Bernardo,"Mireya, muchas gracias por todo. Mi estadía fue excelente. Me sentí muy a gusto en tu apartamento, y no dudaré en contactarte nuevamente para mi próxima visita a Mexico. Saludos. Bernardo<br/>"

1441434,16729546,2014-08-01,7424449,James,This is a nice and safe apartment in one of the best buildings in the city.   Mireya is a warm and friendly host.   We greatly enjoyed our more than 2 week stay.   Highly recommended.
609012,2504501,2012-10-04,1524734,Caio,"I arrived in D.F. one day earlier and Dacio met me at my hotel with his vehicle and took me to his apartment. It is located in a fantastic building (some floors of which are a hotel) on Glorieta Colon, a short walk and about equidistant from the Zocolo and Parque Chapultepec. It is on Reforma, a very safe neighborhood and major thoroughfair that is very close to the U.S. Embassy. The building has a gym and a swimming pool, both of which are open until 11:00 p.m. The internet was sometimes spotty, but I think that's a consequence of the provider, not the router. I have no complaints and would recommend this apartment too anyone."
609012,3090708,2012-12-15,661767,Claudio,"Dacio es un excelente anfitrión. Siempre estuvo atento a solucionar problemas. El departamento es muy cómodo y bien equipado. <br/><br/>Los amenities son muy buenos y vale la pena utilizarlos. <br/><br/>"
609012,3133461,2012-12-22,3924784,Daniel,"This place Is quite nice with a great view. the streets far below are noisy. the apartment was comfortable and clean, very modern. Security was excellent, the pool is fantastic.  Dacio tried to be communicative but because he has never actually lived in the building there is a lot that he doesn't know and didn't explain. Make sure he explains in great detail exactly how the parking works and how to dispose of trash. <br/>The kitchen had adequate dishes, pans, etc. There was only one large bath towel. not enough for two people. we had to make to with the smaller towels."
609012,3297012,2013-01-07,2184053,Pablo,"We went 10 days to Mexico City with my girlfriend. An amazing city full of magic, colors and flavors. There are tons of things of do and see there. We found the city very safe, even at night. I do really recommend Mexico DF. The apartment is just perfect: safe, modern. There are many restaurants and coffees in the area. If you walk just a few blocks you will see many interesting places like La Alameda, El Zocalo, El Templo Mayor and many others. Metro station is about 5 blocks. There is a Metro-Bus a few blocks from the apartment too. You will find a big mall just a few blocks away too. There is a supermarket near, etc. The apartment is pretty nice. There are two bathrooms and a good kitchen. The bed is a little bit small and there is not balcony. Windows are small so it could be a little bit hot. Cable TV and wifi works perfect. 100% recommended."
609012,4017761,2013-04-03,3463970,Maximilian,"Dacio & Fiorenza are great hosts very acomodating and have a really nice apt! location is good if looking for a spot to be near downtown, close to historic center and other sites. building is nice and amenities are nice as well. definetly recommend this place thank you guys! ill definetly keep it in file for friends coming over"

The apartment was impeccably  clean, and looked/felt exactly like the images indicated.<br/><br/>Not to mention the amazing patience he exhibited when he didn't know if was going to keep renting at the end of 2014 ;)<br/><br/>A great, modern, all-inclusive apartment condo if you're looking to be between Polanco, La Condesa, and Roma neighborhoods-- pretty well located for a few days amongst all (easy access).<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
609012,25194925,2015-01-09,2184053,Pablo,"Excellent apartment. Near of everything: subway, supermarkets, commercial centers and historic places. Very safe area.<br/>"
609012,26300949,2015-02-09,4642664,Igor,"Dacio was a phenomenal host during my time in Mexico. <br/><br/>I originally planned to stay only for a short period of time but decided to extend my trip and Dacio was very accommodating, giving me preference to book over other interested parties and guaranteeing the previous rate I had enjoyed when booking a few months earlier.<br/><br/>He and his wife Fiore were always extremely attentive, going as far as to drop off extra bedding when the weather started to become colder before even requesting it.<br/><br/>The apartment looks just as advertised, clean, spacious in a very modern, well appointed and excellently located building."
609012,42927639,2015-08-16,10977268,Pablo,"Dacio was extremely nice and helpful upon my arrival, making sure that I was feeling comfortable and showing me the apartment and the building which I found very well located, clean and with all the things I could need. Gym and pool big plus!"
609012,47482856,2015-09-19,25819958,Luke,"Fantastic location for this apartment, very centralised and surrounded by a busy but safe area.<br/>The apartment complex was very nice. 24/7 doormen. The building was well kept along with this apartment. Inside the apartment it was spotless, really clean and appeared new. A cleaner was available twice who took care of everything needed. The gym and pool was a great amenity to have.<br/>Dacio, the host was available when I arrived and showed me everything I needed to know. I would highly recommend renting this place, I can't fault it at all."
609012,89440192,2016-07-28,2671192,Ricard,"El piso es muy bueno, tiene mucha luz, armarios grandes y un baño perfecto.<br/>El edificio tiene gimnasio con piscina, sauna, cine ... <br/>El unico problema es que se escucha ruido del trafico. <br/>Por el resto es un piso genial"
609012,98740153,2016-09-01,72500733,Martha,"El apartamento en general tiene todo lo necesario, esta localizado en un lugar centrico que para los turistas esta perfecto porque esta cerca de museos y monumentos muy bonitos, lo recomiendo para estancias de corta duracion porque en mi caso me quede un mes y ya no podia dormir debido al ruido que se escucha del trafico 24 horas al dia."
609012,104965373,2016-09-29,35263073,Alexandre,Dacio est un hôte adorable qui a su nous conseiller sur le quartier et plus généralement sur la ville<br/>L'appartement est tres confortable<br/>Tres propre<br/>Tres fonctionnel<br/>La piscine et la salle de sport sont un vrai plus 
609012,137613743,2017-03-16,21543014,Ruan,"Great location, nice pool and jacuzzi, great view. Stayed there for 2 months. Please note there is occasional traffic noise that could be a problem for lite sleepers, but most of Reforma area is like this. <br/>Several supermarkets and restaurants deliver to this location, making it easier for you.<br/>Stone throw from monument revolution, few minutes walk from Alhameda park and Bella Artes. Same for r222 / Reforma 222 shopping mall or about 15 min walk to Buena Vista mall & Walmart.<br/>Closest is Sumesa small supermarket in Calle Londress next to Ripley's."
609012,142872793,2017-04-09,15978959,Ishmael,Great apartment with a scenic view of Mexico City. Place is located in a safe and trendy area within close proximity to shopping mall(reforma 222) and great restaurants. This place is loaded with amenities and definitely worth the money. I wish I could have stayed longer. I felt super safe and they have 24 hour security. Cheers!
609012,312045716,2018-08-22,46500975,James (Adam),Great amenities and location.
609012,329771266,2018-09-29,38914175,Zhen,"One of the best experiences in Airbnb.<br/>Very nice apartment, good location, with a nice 25m pool and gym, sauna etc.<br/>Will definitely recommend."
609012,354361217,2018-12-01,67117346,Chris,"This apartment is located close to the heart of the city. I was able to happily watch the Day of the Dead parade from my living room window. Staff in the building were very friendly. The amenities are outstanding, especially the pool and gym. When city was under water restrictions for almost two weeks, I was still able to have full access to water thanks to the complex's cisterns and tanks."
609012,441323030,2019-04-21,27757345,Aimée,"Me encanta este depto.  La alberca y spa fueron asombrosos, un lugar perfecto para relejarse después de mucho caminar en DF.  Recomiendo este departamento y regresaría por cierto!"
609012,446919614,2019-05-02,188361147,Renato Hideki,"Pros: The apartment is perfect for a couple. It is well located, you can easily grab an uber to go where you need. Patrick and Natividad received me, explained how to get around, where to go, etc, I was well received by them. The pool and jacuzzi are great.<br/>Cons: Not recommended for families with toddlers or babies (not kids friendly). <br/>The floors were a little bit dirty (the place was ‘clean’ but I could tell they didn’t clean the floor as good as I would expect... my feet got dirty in 5 minutes walking around), so we bought a floors cleaning product to clean it better. One of the bath towels had a blood stain. <br/>I booked a stay for 10 days but had an emergency, used the place for only 4 days. They choose the most restrict cancelation policy, thus I didn’t get any refund, not even partial. Tried to negotiate an one-on-one deal, to get at least some money back but did not get any. During my stay, I was asked to receive a realtor and tenants that wanted to rent the apartment full time; we allowed but it was a little bit annoying to have to make plans to receive them (I wouldnt want strangers looking the apartment with our stuff there). <br/>Overall, if you are traveling alone or in a couple and there is no risk for cancelations on your side, I would go for it. The price is good!"
609012,621346936,2020-03-30,67022045,Scarlett,"The apartment was clean and well-decorated.   The location was beyond perfect!  Super convenient for my needs.   I would also highly recommend this for a business traveler, due to the amenities.  Not only is there a great pool and gym, but there are actual designated meeting spaces.   This could be very convenient if you are meeting for business or just need to have a place to take a conference call.    <br/>I wish I had more time to spend there and would select this apartment again if given the opportunity."
44616,21692806,2014-10-21,1503051,Anne,"Fernando is a really nice person, who welcomes is very well. The hostel is good and well located as well! Desajunos is fresh and really tasty! Thanks!! "
44616,25155394,2015-01-07,746388,Ulrika,"We had a lovely stay at the Condesa Haus! Our room was spacious and everything we expected. Best shower we've had in Mexico! The set up is more like a hotel than your typical Airbnb, so we were a little confused at the standardized emails etc. But everything work out great! Only downside was that our room and the building in general was really cold in early January, but once we figured out the heater in our room even this was fine. Would highly recommend staying here! "
44616,26675432,2015-02-17,24498406,Luis,"Our stay was at Condesa DF and we coundn't have asked for a better location.  The location was perfect and walking distance to every desirable restaurant for every budget, from fine dining to your local corner vendor. The neighborhood is very walkable with an abundance of coffee shops and bakeries, bars and everything you want.  The staff at the Inn were very helpful and greeted us every morning for breakfast and offered suggestions.  Next time I'm in La Condesa, I'll definitely check here first.  Thanks for a great stay!"
44616,28315417,2015-03-22,27429333,Marisa,"Super nice airbnb, nice rooms and great location. Many bars, cafes and restaurants within walking distance! We had a perfect stay. "
44616,29883744,2015-04-13,2750776,Frank,"Christian was a gracious host, very helpful and informative.   We were very happy with the Condesa location; it's truly one of the nicest areas in Mexico City and the hotel is very centrally located . <br/><br/>We may look for other options on our next visit to Mexico City.  Even though the staff was very nice,  the room seemed stark, mattress was very, very firm, the tub stopper didn't work, and the floors squeaked with every step.    These sound like minor annoyances but put together make one think that there might be better options for the price paid. "
44616,34876716,2015-06-13,3125811,Margaret,"This is a sweet and simple spot. Clean, the host is great, and there is a lovely patio out back. Highly recommend! "
44616,46989320,2015-09-14,9196590,Priscilla,"Although we never met Fernando, his charming team at reception always made sure to make us feel safe and comfortable. They provided information to secure taxis, breakfast was on time and included fruit, granola, and egg dishes. The room was very clean, with lots of light, clean towels were provided everyday. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience. <br/><br/>The one complaint I would have would be about the building itself. Most of the older beautiful buildings in the Condesa area don't have insulation so you may hear EVERYTHING from each of the rooms and it echoes across the whole place. Not sure how this problem might be addressed, but just a heads up."
44616,54753979,2015-11-23,11806614,Amina,Amazing place. Great location. Felt very welcome and staff were extremely helpful. Highly recommended. 
44616,62990087,2016-02-19,4435307,Jordan,"Fernando was extremely friendly and accommodating, greeting us immediately upon our arrival and introducing us to the other staff at Condesa Haus. He provided information about the area and offered advice and suggestions on places to visit whenever we asked, even joining us for breakfast once. The hostel itself has a lot of charm, is very comfortable with good amenities, and in a great location. Access to the roof was also sweet."
44616,76586515,2016-05-28,57574177,Mary,"What a great find! Condesa Haus is very clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, nestled in a quiet, yet centrally located neighborhood. All the staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. All the amenities of a hotel and great breakfast. Can't be beat!"
44616,98978722,2016-09-02,11269235,Rosalind,"Fernando's B&B totally exceeded expectations! Although he was out of the country, Fernando's staff went above and beyond to make our stay in Mexico City go smoothly. The space was beautiful, the breakfast delicious and the neighborhood full of bars, restaurants, and shops. I can't recommend it enough!"
44616,121370931,2016-12-16,24638123,Andrew,"Condesa house is great! Always someone around to answer questions, very friendly staff, good food and clean rooms! Feels more like you're staying in the guest room of a friend's house then at a hotel. I've been to CDMX 10 times in the last 2 years and spent 9 of them at CH."
44616,218271534,2017-12-11,72240867,Catherine,I loved the location and the wonderful hospitality! I felt very safe and there were good eating places nearby. Fernando was quick to respond to messages and his staff Carlos and Mariana were incredibly friendly and helpful with excellent English. I especially recommend a day trip to Teotihuacan with Mariana as your driver and guide. She is a delightful companion with perfect English. She took me to a local handicrafts shop where I got to taste the traditional drink made from aloe cactus plants and learn about local dyeing and weaving. Highly recommend this B&B!
44616,236625803,2018-02-19,299681,Lisa,Great location! The rooms were  just as described and very comfortable. Nice breakfast.  Mariana was gracious  and very helpful.
44616,247181679,2018-03-27,5072154,Lindsey,Condesa Haus is a lovely bed and breakfast in a tree filled neighborhood in Mexico City perfect for exploring. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast immensely!
44616,249694568,2018-04-02,88396515,Greg,"Awesome location, close to bars, restaurants, and not too far of a walking distance from lots of tourist attractions. Fernando was quick to respond to queries and provided great restaurant recommendations. A gr8 place to stay."

1441434,19074857,2014-09-06,17844800,Jacqueline,"My husband and I stayed in this apartment for four wonderful nights. It was perfectly located. Restaurants, shopping, easy access to taxis and transit right outside our door. We felt very safe in the area as it was always bustling.<br/>The apartment is exactly like the pictures.  Mireya, responded to every inquiry we had making us feel quite at home. <br/>We made us of the facilities as well, the gym, the steam room and jacuzzi. <br/>My husband and I can't wait to return. <br/>Thank you again Mireya for being a wonderful host."

The apartment was very clean with excellent Internet access and cable TV. The washer/dryer was an added bonus. Our host, Mireya, was very responsive and personally brought us a thick wool blanket and space heater when it got cold at night. My wife and I would happily return here and recommend it to anyone.<br/>Arturo & Gabrielle"

1441434,26515822,2015-02-15,11074160,Kit,"Mireya met us right on time as planned and made us feel very welcome. It was late on Saturday night and she ran out to the grocery store to get us water, juice, soda, cookies, fruit and other essentials. Throughout the week we stayed in the apartment, Mireya checked in with us several times to make sure that everything was ok for us. The apartment is just as pictured; the windows look out over the city skyline, a park-like roof top garden, a track, and swimming pool. Everything was perfect, very clean, and in working order. Mireya provides a book with maps, tourist bus routes, and nearby restaurants. The neighborhood is busy and nice with shops, restaurants, and bakeries nearby. It is very easy to get a taxi around the block, in front of the shopping mall. We felt very safe in the location. There are attendants at the door 24/7 for great building security. Three restaurants we really liked are De Mar A Mar for excellent seafood (Niza 13), Luau for Chinese (Niza 38-B), and El Bajia for Mexican (Reforma 222 Mall). <br/>Mexico City is very large but easy to get around with plenty of shopping, cultural, anthropological and archeological opportunities. We found the Mexican people to be very friendly, kind, and helpful.<br/>Mireya, thanks for hosting us in your city!"
1441434,27030902,2015-02-23,9704519,Seth,We were very happy with the apartment. Mireya made sure we had everything we needed and kept in regular contact during our stay. She was also very helpful when we wanted to extend our stay for another night.

1441434,30887695,2015-04-28,3365441,Alexander,"Estuve en el D.F. dos semanas por trabajo y opté por hospedarme en un apartamento en vez de permanecer dos semanas en un Hotel. Fué mi segunda experiencia con Airbnb. Mi decisión fué acertada y pienso haber tenido suerte de poderme haber hospedado esas dos semanas en el departamento de Mireya. La descripción es acertada. El departamento está bien ubicado, es amplio y cuenta con buenas comodidades. En mi estadía aprecié en particular la seguridad, el amplio espacio incluso para trabajar, la buena ubicación (Reforma 222) para mis citas de trabajo a lo largo de Insurgentes, en la torre 2 del complejo y en Polanco, la pista de tartán para hacer jogging y la piscina semi-olímpica para nadar ambos en la terraza a un piso debajo del departamento, la buena conexión de internet, la lavadora/secadora. La cocina está bien equipada aunque por las varias opciones cercanas para comer casi no la usé, más que para eventualmente hacer té y hervir unos huevos. Aunque no nos conocimos personalmente todo funcionó bien, y mantuvimos buen contacto. Muy gentil el detalle de bienvenida que encontré a mi llegada: frutas frescas, una botella grande de agua y unos detalles más en la refrigeradora. Muchas gracias Mireya! Espero poder volver a hospedarme en tu departamento en una próxima oportunidad."
